# Coding standards

Coding standards for development.

- [HTML](./html/)
- [CSS](./css/)
- [SCSS](./scss/)
- [JavaScript](./javascript/)
- [jQuery](./jquery/)

## Guiding principles

- Progressive enhancement.
Webpages should first work as plain HTML. A larger audience can read content inside of HTML, compared to CSS and JS.
Technologies such as CSS and JS can be layered on top of HTML to enhance the user experience.

## Guiding principles

- Mobile first.

    Create your styles for the smallest device first and then progress to larger devices.
    This creates advantages for both developer and user:
     - CSS is inherited in larger devices without duplication of code;
     - Mobile devices will only load resources necessary for the device.
