# Coding standards

Coding standards for development.

- [HTML](./html/)
- [CSS](./css/)
- [SCSS](./scss/)
- [JavaScript](./javascript/)
- [jQuery](./jquery/)

## Guiding principles

- Progressive enhancement.
Webpages should first work as plain HTML. A larger audience can read content inside of HTML, compared to CSS and JS.
Technologies such as CSS and JS can be layered on top of HTML to enhance the user experience.
