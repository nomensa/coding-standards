# Coding standards

Coding standards for development.

- [HTML](./html/)
- [CSS](./css/)
- [SCSS](./scss/)
- [JavaScript](./javascript/)
- [jQuery](./jquery/)

## Guiding principles

- DRY: Don't repeat yourself.
  Try to refactor code so that it is not repeated.
  Repeating code can affect the following aspects of the code:
  - Maintainability;
  - Readability;
  - Efficiency.

Each one is as important the next and focusing on just one can detriment the other.
